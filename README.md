_Generate api docs based on functional tests_

### Roadmap

<!-- * construct a small server under "/bin" as proof of concept -->
<!-- * clever way to grab test name -->
<!-- * maybe skip getting the test name and focus on turning the solution agnostic to "axios" -->
<!-- * on backend, use headers as tracking resource (turning it agnostic to axios) -->
<!-- * save request information on a - redux shape - state tree (looks interesting) -->
* generate github page
