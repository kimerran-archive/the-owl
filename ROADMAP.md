## ROADMAP

* remove parcel

* Replace "uuid" with "rev-hash"
Hashes can be created from the test name, and they can be used as an id.
Generating a new id everytime we run the pipeline will cause git to point changes on tests that weren't changed at all

* configure chalk under `misc`

* integrate with travis-ci

* add code coverage (codecov)
* add linter (xo)
* improve docs (I dunno, I feel it can be bettter)
