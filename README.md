_Generate api docs based on functional tests_

### Roadmap

* construct a small server under "/bin" as proof of concept
* clever way to grab test name
* on backend, use headers as tracking resource (turning it agnostic to axios)
* save request information on a - redux shape - state tree (looks interesting)
* generate github page
